        <div id="bullet-list">
        <ul>
          <li><b>c. 1930</b> - Born in Bugnay, Tinglayan, Kalinga-Apayao</li>
          <li><b>1960s</b> - Became a <i>pangat</i>, those listened to by the community for their wisdom and courage, and was also elected barrio captain of Bugnay for three consecutive terms since 1966.</li>
          <li><b>1974</b> - the Marcos regime tried to implement a 1,000-megawatt hydroelectric power project, to be funded by the World Bank, along the Chico River. As many as 100,000 people living along the river, including Macliing’s Bugnay village, would have lost their homes.</li>
          <li>As a <i>pangat</i> of the Butbut, he was one of the first leaders to oppose the project, organizing a <i>bodong</i> (peace council) in Barrio Tanglag in 1974 as an attempt to rally opposition against the dam.</li>
          </ul>
          </ul>
           <blockquote cite="Dulag">If you destroy life in your search for what you say is the good life, we question it.</blockquote>
          <ul>
          <li>He became a strong and articulate figure in this struggle which pitted nearly powerless communities in the Cordilleras against the powerful martial law regime.</li>
          <li><b>1975</b> - the Episcopal Commission on Tribal Filipinos of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines helped organize another bodong involving 150 Bontoc and Kalinga leaders alongside church-based support groups, at St. Bridget's School in Quezon City.</li>
          <li>These early opposition efforts forced the Marcos administration to temporarily pull the NAPOCOR survey teams out of the area in 1975.</li>
          <li>Macliing expressed the people's reverence for the land, affirming their right to stay.</li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote cite="Dulag">Such arrogance to say that you own the land, when you are owned by it! How can you own that which outlives you? Only the people own the land because only the people live forever. To claim a place is the birthright of everyone. Even the lowly animals have their own place…how much more when we talk of human beings?</blockquote>
          <ul>
              <li>April 24, 1980 - he was murdered by government soldiers. His house was surrounded at night and bullets were sprayed.</li>
              <li>His assassination pushed more opposition to the dam project. People in the country and even outside had sympathized with his death and bravery. The World Bank, which would have funded the dam construction, also withdrew their contribution and this lead the project to be cancelled.</li>
          </ul>
